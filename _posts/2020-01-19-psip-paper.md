Within the context of scientific software research and development, software process improvement (SPI) is undeveloped territory. While software has garnered increasing importance in the scientific computing field in recent decades, and while researchers perceive tremendous value in improving software practices, lack of time and resources along with the complexities of traditional SPI methods have hindered the adoption of better software practices.

The Productivity and Sustainability Improvement Planning (PSIP) process recognizes that productivity and sustainability improvements for scientific software benefit from an incremental, iterative approach.  This paper presents an overview of PSIP and how it compares to other software process improvement methods. Also mentioned are case studies that describe how the use of PSIP led to successful improvements in team effectiveness and efficiency.

This paper is good read for anyone embarking on the PSIP journey with an aim of reducing the technical debt of their project and improving long-term software quality and sustainability.
